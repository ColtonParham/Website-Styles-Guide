This projects purpose is to provide simple website styles guides. 

Path for viewing is indeed, a staircase type.

The purpose of this website is to be a small little project for creating a simple style guide on many different topics, including:
 - Colors
 - Fonts
 - Styles Used

This will be uploaded to github as a repository for "Website Design Website" or something of the similar family. 

As some code may not look perfect, it acts as a test, to test out my current knowledge of not only CSS, but HTML as well. 

Website focuses primarily on 4 elements, including the Header("Website Styles Guide" Title), Colors Element, Font Element and Text Styles element. 

Any and all work was created by Colton Parham, with the exceptions of any fonts.

It is encouraged to look at this website and mess with it as needed.

As this code may be spaghetti, I am still getting used to larger projects.
