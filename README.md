KBINDEX is what the website is going to be called. 

Okay lets get into this project as a starting point. We are creating a website of the sort, using the design elements we have learned. REFER to the JSFULLSTACKSLEARNING GIST on github, will be our lifesaver since it has a lot of useful stuff that I started to write down. 

The purpose of this website is to be a small little project for creating a simple style guide on many different topics, including:
 - Colors
 - Fonts
 - Styles Used

This will be uploaded to github as a repository for "Website Design Website" or something of the similar family. 

As some code may not look perfect, it acts as a test, to test out my current knowledge of not only CSS, but HTML as well. 

Website focuses primarily on 4 elements, including the Header("Website Styles Guide" Title), Colors Element, Font Element and Text Styles element. 

Any and all work was created by Colton Parham, with the exceptions of any fonts.

It is encouraged to look at this website and mess with it as needed.

As this code may be spaghetti, I am still getting used to larger projects.
